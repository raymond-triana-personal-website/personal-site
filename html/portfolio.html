      <h2>Planned V. Actual</h2>
      <p>
        <b> Purpose: </b>
        To create a report to track the planned time vs the actual time a driver
        took to complete a route.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Description:</b>
        <br />
        The Planned V. Actual report is a Java program which parses two CSV
        files for information and compiles them into one report. <br />
        This report was made due to the lack of an accurate report despite the
        fact that the information needed to make it was available in parts in
        two separate reports. <br />
        The first report that Planned V. Actual looks at is called HOS Records
        Timecard which has an accurate off duty time and GPS location. <br />
        The second report that is parsed is coincidentally named Planned V.
        Actual By Drivers which houses an accurate on duty time, planned time,
        driver ID, name, tractor, and GPS location. <br />
        My report caches the first on duty time taken after the driver has
        driven more than 1 mile away from the yard as the start time of the
        route, the time a driver goes off duty while in a yard, and does a
        simple subtraction to get the elapsed time. <br />
        This elapsed time is the compared to the planned time it should take to
        complete the route giving us the time the driver is ahead or behind
        schedule. <br />
        All of this information is finally printed out as a TreeView in JavaFX
        and can be saved as a CSV for excel importing.
