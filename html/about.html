    <p>
      I try to make the most of my free time so when I'm not at work you could
      catch me doing the following:
    </p>

    <h2 class="subheader">Programming</h2>
    <p>
      Programming is a super fun skill that I try to make an aspect of my daily
      life. <br />
      At my current job I am given tasks to create tools which further
      streamline and automate monotonous tasks. <br />
      These programs include reports writte in Java or batch operations
      completed with Python. <br />
      <br />
      Outside of work I try to practice programming as well in a fun manner
      through game development. <br />
      While I have no plan to quit my job to chase a game-dev dream, game
      developement does offer fun and challenging ways to practice in its own
      right. <br />
      From coding State Machines, Behavior Trees, or even figuring out how to
      write shaders. <br />
      These challenges help to further my understanding of computing and
      programming in general.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheader">Archery</h2>

    <p>
      I've recently taken up Archery to spend time on the weekends. <br/>
      This only manifests itself as backyard target shooting as a zen experience to chat and hit targets. <br>
